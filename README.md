# House Pricing Prediction

## Introduction
This project aims to predict house prices based on various features using linear regression. The dataset used in this project is from [Kaggle's House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data).

## Dataset
The dataset includes various features related to house properties such as square footage, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, etc.

## Methodology
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
2. Feature Engineering
3. Model Training and Evaluation
4. Visualization

## Requirements
1. pandas
2. numpy
3. seaborn
4. matplotlib
5. scikit-learn
6. jupyter

## Results
The model achieved an R-squared value of 0.63 and a mean squared error of 2,806,426,667.25 on the test data.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-pricing-prediction.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd house-pricing-prediction`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook notebooks/house_pricing_prediction.ipynb`

## Conclusion
The linear regression model provided reasonable predictions for house prices. Further improvements could include additional feature engineering and exploring other machine learning models.
